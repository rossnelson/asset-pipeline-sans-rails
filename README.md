## Asset Pipeline without Rails

Generate js and css from sass and coffescript. `bundle` then run `guard start`. 

> This will watch the sass and coffescript files in the source directory. On file modification the compiler will run.

All compiled files will be placed in `build/<asset_name>`. This goes for images as well.
